    Chicken Tetrazzini combines cooked vermicelli, chicken, and mushrooms with a rich sherry–Parmesan cheese sauce.
    The mixture is sprinkled with breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese and baked until bubbly and golden.
    This is a great way to use leftover cooked chicken.Parmesan is full of flavor, so a little goes a long way.

Ground beef continues to be the favorite for American red-meat eaters, accounting for 60% of all fresh beef prepared in-home, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Americans eat an average of three burgers per week—50 billion burgers per year. That's a lot of beef and, depending on the mix, a lot of fat.
